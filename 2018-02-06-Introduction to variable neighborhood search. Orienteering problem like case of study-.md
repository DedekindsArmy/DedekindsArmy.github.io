**Abstract**: In this talk, we are going to explore the popular metaheuristic known as the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS). 
After a brief introduction, we will dive into the most common types of VNS used in the literature since it was proposed by 
Mladenovic and Hansen, in 1997. The VNS has been applied to a variety of problems, and the well-known Orienteering Problem (OP) has not been the
exception. 

The OP is a NP-hard problem that combines the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Knapsack problem, a perfect case study 
for a first contact with the VNS. To complete our tour, we will see a more advanced scenario where the VNS is applied to the
Generalized Orienteering Problem, a nonlinear extension of the OP where the VNS has produced promising experimental results.
