Welcome to the official blog of Dedekind's Army.

## Who are we
**Dedekind's Army** is a volunteer-driven project in [Universidad Complutense de Madrid](https://www.ucm.es/)
which organizes classes covering introduction to diverse math topics. The classes are imparted by and for college students.

Two reasons have motivated the foundation of the project:

1. We feel that there are many several topics of interest in math that are pushed aside
in the standard curriculum. We want to promote self-study of such topics, and give students
a way of sharing their passions.
2. Many students are considering pursuing a life as teachers in college or institutes. In DA, they can
try for themselves what teaching is like, and build the communication skills needed for it.

This webpage serves as both a repository of lecture notes and a central hub to announce and organize [events](/calendar).

Jaime Sevilla is a Mathematics and Computer Engineering undergrad student in the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain.

He is headed towards becoming a researcher in Safe Artificial Intelligence. He is a Summer Fellow of the [Machine Intelligence Research Intitute](https://intelligence.org/) and an alumni of the [Center For Applied Rationality](rationality.org). He has spoken in several conferences about Artificial Intelligence, Rationality and Effective Altruism, as well as organized several workshops and activities related to those fields.

He has also lead a couple of entrepreneurship-related projects and has won several math contests and programming hackathons.

His research interests lie in logic, computability, complexity, probability, machine learning and the theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence, among other things.

In Dedekind's Army, he teaches subjects related to the research of foundational safe artificial intelligence. Most of his classes fall within the scope of the topics listed in [MIRI's research agenda](https://intelligence.org/research-guide/).

### Diego Chicharro
*Cofounder, site manager and teacher*

Diego Chicharro is an undergraduate student at the Complutense University of Madrid, studying a joint degree in Mathematics and Physics.

He aims to become a mathematical researcher in a field that is still to be determined. Within his main interests lie number theory, complex analysis, field theory and topology.

He also likes spending time researching elementary number theory, summation methods, and asymptotics, and thoroughly enjoys solving challenging problems, in particular olympiad-like problems. That is the reason why in his classes a problem-solving spirit is always noticeable.

### Gonzalo Gómez

Gonzalo Gómez is a studies Mathematical Engineering in the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain.

The first time he read a serious Mathematics Book from the University Library, he only got to the third page before realizing, in horror, that there were no pictures or diagrams. In fact, there were only definitions, theorems and proofs. Since that very day, Gonzalo fights a war against formalism that will never be won.

Meanwhile, he naively tries to find applications for mathematics in something that resembles reality, as well as solving problems that have a visual, intuitive solution.

His favourite topics are Group Theory, Combinatorics, Geometry, Game Theory, Chaos Theory, Complexity and Abstract Algebra, in that order.

**Classes taught:**
Axiomatic Origami - Groups in Games
