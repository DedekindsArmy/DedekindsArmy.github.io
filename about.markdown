Welcome to the official blog of Dedekind's Army.

## Who are we
Dedekind's Army is a volunteer-driven project in [Universidad Complutense de Madrid](https://www.ucm.es/)
which organizes classes covering introduction to diverse math topics. The classes are imparted by and for college students.

Two reasons have motivated the foundation of the project:

1. We feel that there are many several topics of interest in math that are pushed aside
in the standard curriculum. We want to promote self-study of such topics, and give students
a way of sharing their passions.
2. Many students are considering pursuing a life as teachers in college or institutes. In DA, they can
try for themselves what teaching is like, and build the communication skills needed for it.

Jaime Sevilla is a Mathematics and Computer Engineering undergrad student in the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain.

He is headed towards becoming a researcher in Safe Artificial Intelligence. He is a Summer Fellow of the Machine Intelligence Research Intitute and an alumni of the Center For Applied Rationality. He has spoken in several conferences about Artificial Intelligence, Rationality and Effective Altruism, as well as organized several workshops and activities related to those fields.

He has also lead a couple of entrepreneurship-related project as a startup leader and has won several math contests and programming hackathons.

His research interests lie in logic, computability, complexity, probability, machine learning and the theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence, among other things.

In Dedekind's Army, he teaches subjects related to the research of foundational safe artificial intelligence. Most of his classes fall within the scope of a topic listed in [MIRI's research agenda](https://intelligence.org/research-guide/).

Classes taught: Set theory - Equinumerability - Computability
