**Abstract**:

In  order  to  be  mathematically accurate,  classical  mechanics  need a  set  of  axiomatic principles. These principles should allow us to deduce the most basic laws of motion (Newton’s laws) from them, but they should also enable us to discover physical laws of  new,  more  abstract  systems.  The  principle  of  least  action  is  perhaps  the  simplest postulate  that  enables  us  to  do  just  that.  Also,  it  gives  us  new  ways  of  looking  at complex  problems,  via  Euler-Lagrange equations, and even a  deeper understanding of  why  certain  quantities,  such  as  energy  or  momentum,  are  conserved.

This last result is proved  by Noether’s theorem, one of the most elegant theorems in  both physics and mathematics.
