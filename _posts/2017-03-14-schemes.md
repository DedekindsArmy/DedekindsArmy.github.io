**Place**: Room 103

**Abstract**:
Our goal in this talk will be to justify the introduction of **schemes** in algebraic geometry.

We will first give an overview of classical algebraic geometry
over an algebraically closed field.  After this, we will give a brief introduction
to the theory of sheaves, keeping always in mind the example of the sheaf of
regular functions on an algebraic variety. Then we will see how schemes arise as
the natural way to generalize and extend our algebraic varieties.  Finally we will
discuss two key constructions with schemes, namely the gluing and the fibered
product of schemes.

With all this machinery, we will be able to give a glimpse of
the powerful generalizations achieved with the introduction of schemes in alge-
braic geometry, such as the integration of algebraic number theory and algebraic
geometry, leading for example to Deligne's proof of the Weil Conjecture.
