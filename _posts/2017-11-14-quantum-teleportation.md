**Abstract**:

Quantum  mechanics  is the most accurate tested  theory in the history  of science. It is something  striking  because it is well known that quantum  mechanics  is an inherently probabilistic theory, and therefore, it seems  difficult to test it with such an accuracy. Moreover it seems  really difficult to obtain some benefit  from the laws of quantum  mechanics  in order to improve  our technologies. 

In this  talk, I will introduce  the basic principles  of quantum  mechanics  and show that it is possible  to take advantage  of them to do fancy things  like quantum  teleportation  in a very simple  way. This quantum  technology  will introduce  us directly  into the heart of quantum mechanics  and it will bring us in the deepest  of quantum  mechanics,  the most shocking  facts that follow from its apparently  simple principles.
