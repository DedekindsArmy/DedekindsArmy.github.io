**Abstract**:
Homology is perhaps one of the most beautiful theories in mathematics. It exceedes the standard algebraic structures and defies our usual geometric approaches to the concept of shape, and far from being vacuous, it proves, from the inmensity of different phenomena ultimately involving homology, to capture the true essence of both algebra and topology. In this talk we will try to give a glimpse of this theory, carefully combining geometric intuition and algebraic formality.

## Lecture notes
You can find the contents of the talk explained in [Mathifold](http://mathifold.org/es/exposition_homology.html).

## Proposed exercises
Find the Euler-Poincaré characteristic of:
* The solid sphere
* The solid torus
* The [projective plane](http://mathifold.org/en/example_projective_plane.html)
* [Poincaré's sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_sphere#Poincar.C3.A9_homology_sphere)
