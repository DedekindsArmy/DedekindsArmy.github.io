**Place**: Room 102

**Abstract**:
Homology is perhaps one of the most beautiful theories in mathematics. It exceedes the standard algebraic structures and defies our usual geometric approaches to the concept of shape, and far from being vacuous, it proves, from the inmensity of different phenomena ultimately involving homology, to capture the true essence of both algebra and topology. In this talk we will try to give a glimpse of this theory, carefully combining geometric intuition and algebraic formality.
