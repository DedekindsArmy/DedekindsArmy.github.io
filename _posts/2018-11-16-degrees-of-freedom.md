**Abstract**:

The degrees of freedom of a problem, distribution, space, or shape is
the minimum number of real numbers required to describe it. We define
the degrees of freedom of a set of objects in general and offer
several interpretations of the concept.

Then we show several examples and applications of this concept in
fields such as projective geometry, electrical engineering,
statistics, algebra, triangles and multicopters.
