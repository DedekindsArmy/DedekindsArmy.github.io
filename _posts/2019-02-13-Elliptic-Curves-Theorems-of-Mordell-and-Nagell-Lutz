**Abstract**: An elliptic curve is an irreducible smooth cubic curve. At first glance, such a simple mathematical object should not
harbor any mystery, but nothing could be further from the truth; the theory of elliptic curves is extremely extensive, and in it, 
geometry, algebra and number theory are involved in rather unsuspected ways.

In this presentation, a brief exposition of the main problems and results of this theory is offered: namely, the Mordell and 
Nagell-Lutz theorems.
