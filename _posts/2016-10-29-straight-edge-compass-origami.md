**Abstract**:
 This conference is about how we can solve geometric problems drawing the solution with a certain set of tools. First, we explain the geometrical constructions that can be made with the classical straight edge and compass, calculating all the constructible points. We then introduce the problem of angle trisection, showing its relation with cubic equations, and that it is not solvable with a straight edge and compass. In order to solve angle trisection, we introduce a new construction, neusis, and a new set of rules, namely those of origami. Finally, we calculate constructible points for the origami constructions.
