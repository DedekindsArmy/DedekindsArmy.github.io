First of all, a list of links to the previous year's lecture notes:

* [Set theory](pdffiles/set_theory.pdf).
* [Equinumerability](pdffiles/equinumerability.pdf).
* [Basic computability](pdffiles/basic_computability.pdf) + [Turing Machine Compiler](https://github.com/Jsevillamol/PythonUTM).
* [Number Theory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByOY0ltwG6s-RFRpcE1fQnM2VEk/view?usp=sharing) + [Problems](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByOY0ltwG6s-SHJQME9iV2s1bm8/view?usp=sharing) + [Solutions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByOY0ltwG6s-RXdBUjU4Wjh3cmM/view?usp=sharing).

See the [next post]({% post_url 2016-08-5-last-year-content %}) for an in-depth recompilation, with summaries and extra exercises.

We were planning to do, apart from the classes, some olympiad-like competitions, by teams. Discuss below whether you like the idea. Here is an example of problem:


<span class="capsule">**Problem.**</span> Compute the sum
\\[\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{\cos(n)}{2^n}\\]

However, do not expect the problems to be so easy!

From now on, we will publish the lecture notes, problems, solutions, etc. in this blog. If you are a lecture, and want to make some lecture notes, we encourage you to use our **[template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByOY0ltwG6s-WUZlZXQ2MTdrZ0U/view?usp=sharing)**.
