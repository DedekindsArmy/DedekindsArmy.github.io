**Abstract**:
Quantum mechanics is the best theory of physics to date. It is also the subject of many paradoxes and apparent violations of common sense. One of these paradoxes concerns quantum correlations: cooperative games can be won with higher probability using quantum resources than using only classical, ‘common-sense’ resources. This, in turn, has applications in efficient communication of information and extra-secure cryptography. In this talk I’ll introduce a cooperative game and show how to use quantum resources to win with high probability. By doing this, I’ll state and prove Bell’s theorem.
