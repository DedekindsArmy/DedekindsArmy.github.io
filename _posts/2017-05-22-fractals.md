**Place**: Room 103

**Abstract**:
One of the early applications of Montel's theorem was in complex dynamics, the study of the behaviour of the iterates of analytic and meromorphic functions. Julia and Fatou used Montel's theorem to study iterates of rational functions.

In this lecture we will introduce a few concepts from complex analysis to understand Montel's theorem, and we will applyt them to understand some basic facts about Fatou and Julia sets.
