Here is a brief summary of what has happened in Dedekind's Army since we resumed our activity after the winter break:

* We have organized 6 high quality classes from and for enthusiasts of math, achieving an attendance of about 30 people per class
* We have hosted the 1st edition of Dedekind's Army official Mathematical Olympiad. We got ~20 participants who engaged with 11 challenging problems from diverse areas of math. Check out the proposed problems [here]({% post_url 2017-04-02-dmo %}). Congratulations to the [winners]({%link hallOfFame.md %})! Big shout-out to Gonzalo Gómez and Diego Gómez Chicharro for organizing the event. Keep yourself tuned in for future editions!
* We now have a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7zwNUOPfxA)! One video uploaded so far, with many more to come!

Soon we will formally announce our next talk, which will be about Information Theory. The intended schedule is to organize a talk every two weeks as last year's.
