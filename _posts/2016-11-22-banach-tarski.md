**Abstract**:
The Banach-Tarski theorem is one of the most controversial results of mathematics. It claims that you can cut a sphere in a finite number of pieces which can be turned around in order to produce two spheres identical to the original one. In this class we are going to prove this theorem and comment on the apparent paradox.
