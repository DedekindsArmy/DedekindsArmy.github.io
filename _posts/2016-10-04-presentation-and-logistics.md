Thank you to all the assistants of the inaugural session!

Here is a summary of the logistics we discussed:

1. We will meet once every two weeks. The day and hour is still to be determined. Please vote in [this poll](http://doodle.com/poll/itbh2vbbkcirrhxq) to have a say in that. As late as next Friday it will be published in this blog when and where the next session will happen.

2. We are still looking for people to give classes! Let us know through our [mail](mailto:dedekindsarmy@gmail.com) if you would like to try. Do not be afraid of doing it! If you want to do it but you are unsure of how to prepare a class, we will help with that as well.

3. In general, classes will be announced one week in advance, with a title and an abstract. We encourage teachers to write up some lecture notes to help in preparing the class and then share it in the blog, though it is by no means necessary.

4. Nothing was said about the mathematical olympiad. If the project goes on there will be an announcement in the future!

Kudos to Diego Chicharro for the awesome webpage, Gonzalo Gómez for generally helping with everything, Decanato for allowing us to have a class and Delegación for their support, and of course to you for reading this blog post.

## About the class
Formal logic is rather dense and can be a pain to understand, but I am pleased to see that many of you stayed through the session trying to make sense of my excited and hand wavy claims, and making really smart questions.

I have written [another post]({% post_url 2016-10-04-godel-lob-viceversa %}) with some observations and clarifications, as well as some lecture notes and bibliography for those interested.
