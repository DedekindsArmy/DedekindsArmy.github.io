### Journey Through $\pi$
**Lecturer**: Diego Chicharro Gordo.

**Date**: pending.

**Abstract**: We all know how important the number $\pi$ is. Some non-mathematical people think of $\pi$ as the rational number $3.14$. Other people, those who think that they know something about mathematics, reckon $\pi$ as a number with a lot of decimal figures. Even sometimes these people memorize $\pi$ up to 10,000 digits, and say latter: *"I'm a mathematician, you know."*  

In this short lecture we'll examine a rigorous definition and derive several nice formulas that involve this well-known number. The irrationality of $\pi$ is proved in detail, and its transcendence is also discussed.

### Löb's theorem, Gödel II and vice versa
**Lecturer**: Jaime Sevilla Molina

**Date**: 04/10/2016

**Abstract**:
The goal of this class is to present and discuss two central results of modern logic, Löb's theorem and Gödel II.

We will begin by introducing the notion of a formal proof, and of a provability predicate. We will then prove
Löb's theorem assuming the Hilbert-Bernais derivability conditions for the standard provability predicate.

Finally we will discuss Gödel's second incompleteness theorem, emphasizing its relation to Löb's theorem.
