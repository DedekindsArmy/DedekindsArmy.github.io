### Löb's theorem, Gödel II and vice versa
**Lecturer**: Jaime Sevilla Molina

**Date**: 04/10/2016

**Abstract**:
The goal of this class is to present and discuss two central results of modern logic, Löb's theorem and Gödel II.

We will begin by introducing the notion of a formal proof, and of a provability predicate. We will then prove
Löb's theorem assuming the Hilbert-Bernais derivability conditions for the standard provability predicate.

Finally we will discuss Gödel's second incompleteness theorem, emphasizing its relation to Löb's theorem.
