**Abstract**:

We will introduce the necessity of causal inference via Simpson's paradox, the notion of causal graphical models as a way of representing probabilistic causal models,
explain how to compute the effect of interventions using a graphical model, and overview the problems of causal discovery 
(learning the orientation of the edges of a causal model) and causal identifiability (measuring the strength of a causal link).
