We are ready to start our first session with lots of enthusiasm!

<img src="https://document-export.canva.com/DAB_Wkdfz5w/20/preview/0001-42.png" alt="Poster" style="width: 750px;"/>
The session will take place in the room 102 of the Math Faculty of Universidad Complutense de Madrid, the 4th of October from 15:30 to 16:30.

In this session we will start by getting to know each other, and then we will explain how Dedekind's Army is going to work (for those who cannot assist, do not worry, there will be a detailed post here later). This introduction will last 15 minutes.

After that Jaime Sevilla will give the first class of this academic year: [Löb's theorem, Gödel II and vice versa]({% post_url 2016-08-6-upcoming-lectures %}).

By the way, you can already vote for your preferred day of the week to hold the sessions in this [poll](http://doodle.com/poll/itbh2vbbkcirrhxq). We will try to pick a day which suits the most people.

And if you already have an idea for a class you would like to give, [send us an email](mailto: dedekindsarmy@gmail.com) with a title and an abstract and we will fit you in our schedule!

We are looking forward to seeing you in the inaugural session!

And do not forget to share us with your friends!
