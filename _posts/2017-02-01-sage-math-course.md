 We are pleased to announce that some teachers from the UCM Math faculty are organizing a course on [Sage Math](http://www.sagemath.org/) software.

 For those who have not used it, **Sage Math** is a very complete math environment built using Python which combines the capacities of several well-known open source math packages and motors. If you have not toyed around with its notebooks yet, you should try it!

 The course will start in February and will consist of two hours per weel. If you are interested, please contact [ebaro@ucm.es](mailto:ebaro@ucm.es) for more details.
