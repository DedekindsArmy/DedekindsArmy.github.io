What follows is a recompilation of the notes and exercises they made available after their classes.

## Lectures by Diego Chicharro

## Lectures by Jaime Sevilla

### Set Theory
A gentle introduction to axiomatic set theory.

#### Content
* An introduction to formal mathematics: the axiomatic schema, naive Set Theory and Russell's Paradox.
* The axioms of Set Theory.
* Construction of mathematical objects in Set Theory: tuples, functions, families.
* Peano Arithmetic in Set Theory.
* Equivalence. Finite and infinite sets.

#### Exercises:
**Lecture 1 (20/11/2015)**

* Show that functions are well-formed sets according to the axioms of Set Theory. (Remember, a function from A to B is defined as a subset of $A\times B$ satisfying certain properties)
* Show that $A^{B \times C}$ (the set of all functions from $B \times C$ to $A$) is a well-formed set
* We define $\times_{i\in I}A_i$ as the cartesian product of every member of a family $A_i$ indexed by the set $I$. Show that $\times_{i\in I}A_i$ is a well-formed set.
* Show that if $I$ is a non zero natural number and none of the $A_i$ is the empty set then $\times_{i\in I}A_i$ is not empty. Can we prove this for $I = \omega$?

**Lecture 2 (4/12/2015)**

* Show that the function $+:\omega^{2} \to \omega$ such that $+(n,0) = n$ and $+(n,m^{+}) = +(n,m) ^{+}$ is associative and commutative.
* Prove that if $a + b < a + c$ then $b < c$. (Remember, $a<c \iff a\in c$)
* Prove that $\omega$ is transitive; that is, that $n\in \omega \implies n \subset \omega$.
* Prove that $\omega$ is well-ordered; that is, that each nonempty subset has a least element.


### Equinumerability
Basic results about countable and uncountable sets.

### Computability
The basic definitions and results regarding the study of what can and cannot be computed by an algorithm.

#### Content
* Turing Machines.
* Uncomputability. The diagonal function and the halting problem.
