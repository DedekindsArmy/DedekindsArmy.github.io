We are ready to start our first session with lots of enthusiasm!

The session will take place in the room 117 of the Math Faculty of Universidad
Complutense de Madrid, the 30th of November at 16:00.

In this session we will start by getting to know each other, and then we will
explain how Dedekind's Army is going to work. This introduction will last 15 minutes.

Afterwards Guillermo Gallego SÃ¡nchez will give the first class of this academic
year: [Introduction to cathegory theory]({% post_url 2021-11-30-cathegory-theory %}).

And if you already have an idea for a class you would like to give, [send us an
email](mailto: dedekindsarmy@gmail.com) with a title and an abstract and we will
fit you in our schedule!

We are looking forward to seeing you in the inaugural session!

And do not forget to share us with your friends!
