**Lecturer**: Jaime Sevilla

**Date**: 26/04/2017

**Time**: 17:00

**Place**: Room 103

**Abstract**:
Through this talk we will introduce the basic notions used in the different systems of modal logic, 
after a review of the concepts of the [first order provability predicate and Löb's theorem]({% post_url 2016-10-04-godel-lob-viceversa %}).

After that we will focus on the Gödel-Löb modal system (GL), also known as the logic of provability.
We will discuss Solovay's arithmetical adecuacy theorems, modal fixed points and the Kripke models of GL.
