From now on and until January 2017, the classes will take place every two weeks on **Wednesday's** in **room 103**.

Expect the classes to start at **16:30**, though occasionally we will also start at 17:00, depending on the speaker's choice. The classes will last for one hour.

We are also glad to announce that we have arranged a deal with the faculty to pay for posters announcing the classes.

We in DA want to thank both the institution and its students for the support we have received so far.

Do not miss [the next class](/calendar)!
