### Jorney Through $\pi$ 
**Lecturer**: Diego Chicharro Gordo.

**Date**: pending.

**Abstract**: We all know how important the number $\pi$ is. Some non-mathematical people think of $\pi$ as the rational number $3.14$. Other people, those who think that they know something about mathematics, reckons $\pi$ as a number with a lot of decimal figures. Even sometimes these people memorize $\pi$ up to 10,000 digits, and say latter: *"I'm a mathematician, you know."*  In this short lecture we'll examine a rigorous definition, and several nice formulas that involve this well-known number. The irrationality of $\pi$ is proved in detail, and its transcendence is also discussed.
