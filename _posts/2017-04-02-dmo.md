Corrections and clarifications:

* In the exercise 3.b it should be indicated as help the *Diagonalization lemma*, which states that for every $A$ you can build a sentence $S$ such that it is provable and true that $S$ is true iff we can deduce that $A$ is true from the existence of a proof of $S$.
* In the exercise 9.a the matriz T is the matrix with all entries equal to $3$.

Solutions coming soon!


# Prizes

* First prize: Autoflight Mini Drone
* Second prize: Artesanal Wooden Puzzle
* Third prize: Raspberri Pi

Furthermore, the top three participants will be forever immortalized in our **hall of fame**.
